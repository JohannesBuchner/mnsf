About:

This software allows for the fitting of Fermi GBM and LAT data via Bayesian probabilty. Provided are tools for reading GBM TTE/RSP files,
PHAI files for LAT LLE and standard data, as well as the tools for fitting and examining fit files. It is built upon the associated multiFit
package that wraps the MULTINEST Bayesian inference software. A variety of spectral models are provided but can easily be added too.

Currently, three likelihoods are provided: chi2, cstat, and pgstat.

Much work and more documentation are to come....
